<h1><i><span class="sp1">Has Anybody<br />
Here Seen<br />
Kelly?</span></i></h1>

<h2>By Kenneth O'Hara</h2>

<p class="hd1">Illustrated by Paul Orban</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The Crew</span> pulsed with contentment,
and its communal
singing brought a pleasant kind of
glow that throbbed gently in the
control room.</p>

<p>"'Has anybody here seen Kelly ... K-E-double-L-Y?'"</p>

<p>"Shut up and dig my thought!"
Kelly's stubborn will insisted. "I'm
going on out for a while!"</p>

<p>The delicate loom of the Crew's
light pattern increased its frequency
a little and the song stopped. "Better
not," the Crew said.</p>

<p>"But why not?"</p>

<p>"No need."</p>

<p>"We could be running into something
bad," Kelly thought.</p>

<p>"No danger now, Kelly. Checking
the ship is just a waste of time."</p>

<p>"How can you waste what you
have so damn much of?" Kelly
thought.</p>

<p>"Do not leave us again, Kelly.
We love you and you are the most
interesting part of the Crew when
you're with it."</p>

<p>"The ship ought to be checked.
Our bodies ought to be looked at."</p>

<p>"We know there is no danger
any more, Kelly. Do not go. There
are so many interesting experiences
we have not even begun to share
yet. We are only half way through
your life and we have not even
started to experience your impressions
of your colorful and complex
Earth culture. And we have not
even started on the adult lives of
Lakrit or Lljub. Come back with
your Crew, Kelly."</p>

<p>"But no one's checked the ship
for over a year!"</p>

<p>"Please do not worry about the
ship, Kelly. In fifty years nothing
has gone wrong. We can trust the
ship thoroughly now, it will take
care of us."</p>

<p>"<i>It</i> will take care of <i>us</i>! That's
a helluva way to look at it!"</p>

<p>"There can be no danger now,
Kelly. In fifty years we have encountered
every conceivable danger,
every imaginable kind of world
or possible menace."</p>

<p>"Have we?" Kelly thought.
"Every danger from outside maybe,
and I'm not even sure of that. But
how about danger from inside?"</p>

<p>"Inside?"</p>

<p>"Us. How about apathy for instance?
Apathy's a real danger. You
talk about this space-can like it was
a big metal mother! Listen, I'm
supposed to see that this tub holds
together. At least until we get back
somewhere near enough to the
Solar system so we'll feel we've
been somewhere else!"</p>

<p>"But, Kelly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm getting out for a while, I
tell you!"</p>

<p>"All right," the Crew sighed. The
light loom faded a bit, down to a
self-indulgent glow. "Hurry back to
us, Kelly."</p>

<p>"I'll give some thought to it."</p>

<p>So Kelly concentrated on the increasingly
painful and difficult task
of tearing his consciousness free of
the big glob of protoplasm in the
tank, and getting it back into his
body that hibernated in the bunkroom.</p>

<p>As usual the switch was too painful.
It stretched and stretched and
finally snapped in an all too familiar
explosion of shocking light.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">His bones</span> creaked. His skin
rustled as he sat up and
looked around. There was the old
feeling that there was dust over
everything when there was no dust.
There was all that emptiness sweeping
away into the endless silence
and he thought again, as he always
did, how comforting and cozy it
was being a part of the Crew.</p>

<p>But someone had to check the
ship. It was only machinery after
all, and machinery could wear out,
sooner or later. And he wasn't at
all sure, as he kept insisting, that
they had encountered all the possible
dangers.</p>

<p>It might seem that in fifty years
you could run into everything. But
fifty years was no time at all out
here where time had no real meaning
any more.</p>

<p>His body squeaked as he took a
few tentative steps about the bunkroom.
One did not actually forget
how to walk. It was just awkward
as the devil. And the blood, the entire
autonomic system, tended to
slow down. It seemed reluctant to
step up general metabolism.</p>

<p>Apathy. Sure it was a danger.
This time, Kelly decided, I'll do
something about it. He was the engineer
and he had signed on the
great odyssey to keep the ship going.
But the Crew was part of the
ship. Was not there an obligation
even greater to keep the Crew going?</p>

<p>The four others lived but almost
imperceptibly in some very low
state of slowed metabolism there in
the bunkroom and Kelly looked at
them. The faithful and the wonderful
ones. The ones with whom he
had shared so many dangers and
awful silences that the five of them
had been able to evolve the idea of
the protoplasm in the tank and
merge their consciousness in it.</p>

<p>Kew, the Venusian, in her bowl
of self-renewing nitrate. Lakrit from
a Jovian satellite, a fluorine fellow
of distinction inside a sphere of
gaseous sulphur. A crystalline character
with a sense of humor named
Lljub, whose form gave off a paled
glint as it nourished itself on silicates.
And a highly intelligent but
humble six-foot-long sponge labeled
Urdaz stuck in a foundation of
chemical sediment at the bottom of
a tank of reprocessing salt water.</p>

<p>Each with their own special kind
of appendages and sensitivities,
each able to move his special closed-system
about through the ship by
means of clever types of mobility.</p>

<p>But basically, in outward form,
they were too alien to have much
in common. Only as intelligences,
as life forces, could they share a
common bed. And it had evolved
to that in fifty years. A bed of protoplasm
in a shock-absorbent tank.</p>

<p>Kelly looked at them warmly and
thought about how it had worked
out. The strange thing was that it
did have a lot of good things to
recommend it. Or had had them.
It had solved the problem of intimate
communication and driven
back the tides of loneliness. It had
lessened the dangers of mental and
physical illnesses in the material
bodies and assured a prolongation
of the life of each body, which was
important in itself, for this trip had
proven to be a lot longer than
even the most pessimistic had anticipated.</p>

<p>The Crew, pulsing in its tank,
Kelly thought oddly, is a new life
form. One that had evolved to meet
the exigencies of deep space which
had proven to be alien to any
adaptability common to any world
that rotated through it.</p>

<p>But maybe they were too damn
happy, Kelly thought. Too contented.
If they ran into a real
emergency now, the ship would be
finished. The Crew in the tank
was, itself, incapable of action of
any overt kind. It could not manipulate
anything. It could only be
happy.</p>

<p>And the bodies here in the bunkroom
could not rally fast enough
to meet a sudden crisis.</p>

<p>And they had agreed that the
first law was survival.</p>

<p>But to survive this way might
well mean destruction in another.</p>

<p>So Kelly walked and thought
about it, and weighed the precarious
balance.</p>

<p>He slipped through the silent
ship and to the control room. He
peered into the viewscope. Some
galaxy or other spun its giant pinwheel
outward toward some destiny
of its own. The high noon of the
endlessness had been unfamiliar for
years. He checked the ship's instruments.
The Crew in the big tank
simmered and throbbed in its introspective
bliss, utterly oblivious to
Kelly now.</p>

<p>Kelly saw the red dwarf a few
hundred million kilos away. Three
planets ground their familiar path
around it. The second in distance
had a breathable oxygen, according
to the scopes, but little else to
recommend it.</p>

<p>Kelly straightened up. He had no
idea when the plan had really
started forming, but now it was
formed. When Kelly made up his
mind to a thing, there was no other
course but to conclude it. He knew
what he had to do.</p>

<p>Somehow, even as part of the
Crew, some part of Kelly had been
able to keep that forming plan a
secret. Which was a lucky miracle,
for if the Crew had known his intentions
it would certainly not have
let him out this time.</p>

<p>Even if you wanted out, Kelly
reasoned, the Crew would keep you
in. And maybe after long enough
you did not care to get out. But
once out, he wondered, could it
keep you out if it decided to blackball
a man for one reason or another?</p>

<p>Like wrecking the ship?</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">In the chrome</span> strip above
the control panel, Kelly saw his
face grinning strangely back at him,
a bearded, hollowed, paled face
with an unfamiliar glitter in the
eyes. Every time he had left the
Crew to enter and reactivate his
own body, that body had seemed a
little less familiar. This time it
seemed to be almost entirely someone
else.</p>

<p>He stared at the face in the
chrome, then whispered the hell
with that and he flipped the controls
over to manual. He sat down.
Behind him, the Crew whispered in
its tank, protoplasm developed in
the labs and quivering now with
some unified sensation that was
purely subjective and blissfully unconcerned
with what happened outside
itself.</p>

<p>"It's sick," Kelly concluded, with
an emphatic clamp of his jaws.
"It's not right!"</p>

<p>True, sharing the intimate sensations
of alien life forms like Kew,
the female Venusian, had been exciting.
Especially the sex experiences
which, in a flower of Kew's
type, was certainly something.
There were interesting things to
being a part of the Crew all right.
But the main purpose, survival, had
been forgotten. Now being the Crew
was an end in itself. Kelly could
imagine the Crew business going on
and on until finally even the material
bodies in the bunkroom would
be forgotten entirely and allowed to
rot away to dust about which the
Crew would no longer care.</p>

<p>And that was very bad. It should
not have worked out this way. But
it was not too late to do something,
shake them out of the Lotus
dream.</p>

<p>He checked the scopes again.
Now the second planet revealed
plenty of breathable atmosphere
settled in the lower valleys. He
headed straight for it.</p>

<p>The Crew was soon going to get
one devil of a jolt!</p>

<p>He put the ship into a close orbit
around the planet. It seemed nothing
but a fearsome forest of oxydized
spikes rising in corrosive silence,
with here and there a lean
slash of valley. There was no indication
of life, no vegetation visible
or revealed by the scopes. One of
the valleys had a thin mouth of
water stretching down the length
of its face. Kelly set the speed and
the controls and ran for the bunkroom
and the shock-absorbent
cushions. He strapped himself in
and waited.</p>

<p>It was done. As long as the thing
had gone so far, Kelly decided, the
truth should never be revealed because
that would lessen the therapeutic
value of his action. He would
wreck the ship. Not too badly. Not
so badly that all of the bodies, distinct,
separate individual bodies
again, couldn't put the ship back
together, as in the old days. And
that would keep them in their
bodies gladly for a while where they
belonged! Where the good Lord
had intended for them to stay.</p>

<p>They would not be rocked away
to apathy in a phony metal mother
womb, thinking the ship was going
to take care of <i>them</i>!</p>

<p>The more Kelly thought about it,
the better he felt. He stretched inside
the straps. He felt his slightly
atrophied muscles luxuriate over
the tissues and bones of his big
frame.</p>

<p>Any body, no matter what its
shape, should be proud of itself.
That was Kelly's belief, and this
thing that had happened seemed
somewhat blasphemous. Without
bodies and their complex sensory
recording apparatus, the rich consciousness
enjoyed by the Crew
could not exist, would never have
been created at all. The Crew was
living off the largesse of experience
built up by their bodies. The Crew
was just narcotized enough that it
did not realize that the body banks
had to be replenished.</p>

<p>Metal shrieked.</p>

<p>Kelly yelled feebly. He fought,
he grappled with the threatening
blackout like a man fighting an invisible
opponent on an endless
flight of stairs.</p>

<p>The grinding rolling terror of the
sound, the ripping, twisting, tearing
scream of it cried on and on. Kelly
knew one thing then.</p>

<p>He had not figured it right. His
calculations were off. <i>The ship had
hit too damn hard.</i></p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Later</span>, when he managed to get
the straps off and tried to move,
he fell painfully onto the tilted
deck. One of his eyes felt sticky.
He rubbed at it and his hand was
smeared with blood.</p>

<p>He shuffled around in a stumbling
circle. Minor damages could
have been repaired. But this&mdash;the
ship was peeled open in glaring
strips like a breakfast cannister. A
cold wind moaned through the ship
that was now nothing but a metal
sieve. A hazy light filtered down
and ran off the metal like cold flour
rust.</p>

<p>Kelly fell to his knees. "Kew," he
whispered. "Lljub, Urdaz&mdash;Lakrit...."</p>

<p>The Venusian flower lady was
sliced down the middle like a cabbage,
and the nitrate bowl was
shattered and Kew was dead in a
pool of fading green blood.</p>

<p>Smashed into the bulkhead was
Lakrit's sulphuric bathtub, and his
atmosphere had already filtered
away with the wind to wherever it
was going. Lljub's pale glow was
out for good, and his crystalline
heart was as opaque as a dead eye.
Only a few pieces of Urdaz's tank
were visible, and Urdaz himself had
already turned to a powdery food
that the wind ate slowly in long
trailing streamers.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what in the name of
God have I done?" Kelly whispered.</p>

<p>All dead&mdash;</p>

<p>No! He slammed at the bulkhead
until the warped metal gave
and he ran to the control room.
The Crew&mdash;the Crew&mdash;</p>

<p>He stared at the tank.</p>

<p>Through a jagged opening in the
ship's walls, the wind whined and
plucked at Kelly's red hair. The
wind was colder now. He kept on
looking at the tank. He reached out
and touched the big transparent
curve of it and then jerked his hand
back with a whimper in his breath.</p>

<p>There was nothing in the tank,
nothing but a blob of slowly drying
slime. He pressed his nose to the
tank. "Crew&mdash;" he whispered.</p>

<p>There was no life in the slime.
When he pounded on the tank, the
stuff collapsed in upon itself in
withering flatness.</p>

<p>Kelly yelled. The cold wind
froze at his teeth. It sucked at his
breath and dried at the interior of
his mouth. He ran and climbed.
The jagged periphery of the opening
sliced at his flesh. But he did
not feel it, and he fell twenty feet,
without feeling that either, down
the side of the ship. He started
crawling over the hard naked belly
of the rock.</p>

<p>He got to his feet. He ran stumbling
down an incline of shale worn
round and shiny by the wind that
had blown here just as it blew now,
and would blow for God alone
possibly knew how long. He fell
and rolled to the edge of the water.</p>

<p>He looked into it. He felt of it.
He jerked his hand away. The stuff
was icy. But it was worse than icy.
It was dead. It was dead water. It
was without any bottom, and without
any life in it anywhere. You
could tell by looking into it. The
wind moved over the top of it as
though the water were glass, and
the water was the color of a slightly
transparent naked blue steel.</p>

<p>There was no life here. Maybe
there had been once, who knew
when, who could guess how long
ago. But there was none now and
even the water had forgotten it.</p>

<p>Kelly cried out as he stood up.
"What have I done?" He raised
his arms at the hazy red sun lying
over the spires of towering stone
and metal like a bloated balloon
scraping precariously over rusty
spikes. "God, what have I done?"</p>

<p>The cry echoed tinnily on the
rocks and fled on the wind.</p>

<p>Kelly ran for a long way, falling
and stumbling and getting up
again. Kelly had always had one
primary drive, and that was to keep
going, no matter what. So now he
tried to keep going.</p>

<p>But there was no life on this
planet. He had known that before.
Some strange kinds of intelligence
could tolerate some unpleasant
worlds. But nothing would live
here.</p>

<p>Nothing <i>could</i> live here.</p>

<p>"That's your fate," Kelly thought.
He sat down and stared at the walls
of rock and metal all around. "Your
fate, Kelly. Your punishment, your
well deserved hell."</p>

<p>That was what it was. Retribution.
And knowing that, he tried
not to care. He tried to be glad and
face what he deserved.</p>

<p>If that were not the answer, then
why had only Kelly been spared to
face emptiness and silence and no
life, all alone?</p>

<p>The irony of it was that he would
go on as long as possible keeping
himself alive in his own hell. There
was food aplenty in the ship,
enough to last as long as hell cared
to have him.</p>

<p>He turned and started walking
back toward the ship that seemed
some five miles away. At that instant,
the ship disappeared in an
abrupt explosion that twisted the
rocks, and a mushroom cloud flowered
gently above the lake as Kelly
fell trembling on his belly and
hugged the ground and pushed his
face into the shale, while the wind
tore and screamed around him and
particles of flint ripped his clothes
and slashed at his flesh.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">He did not</span> bother walking
much farther toward where
the ship had been. There was only
a crater there now which would
offer him nothing in the way of sustaining
his very personal and thoroughly
private hell.</p>

<p>He walked. The effort became
more difficult and finally he was on
his hands and knees, crawling. The
wind sucked at his ripped clothes,
and felt like cold sharp steel in his
raw wounds. But slowly and deliberately
he continued to crawl.</p>

<p>Kelly had always had the idea
that a man should keep going and
so now he kept on going. Even if
there was no place to go, and you
could not remember particularly
where you had been, you kept on
moving and fighting and slugging
along until you could no longer
move.</p>

<p>He lay there looking up at the
hazy rust of the sky with the naked
spires pointing up into it for no
reason at all, because there was
nothing up there.</p>

<p>He had been there and he knew.
Nothing up there but space, black
and without a beginning or end. He
had not even checked the records
of the ship so that now, lying here,
he did not even know how far away
from Earth he was. At the speed
they had traveled, a ship went a
long way in fifty years. But the ship,
the records, everything was lost.</p>

<p>And no one would ever know
now how far they had come.</p>

<p>Or gone. What was the difference,
anyway?</p>

<p>But Kelly had no difficulty in remembering
<i>why</i> they had come.</p>

<p>They had come into space because
that was how it was with
those who fought their way up to
being the dominate life form of
whatever world they had lived on
and grown and died on. If you
were the kind who went into space,
you went because space was there.</p>

<p>Who needed a better reason than
that?</p>

<p>"Kew," he whispered. "Lakrit,
Lljub, Urdaz, listen now&mdash;I thought
I was doing the right thing&mdash;maybe
my idea was right&mdash;but I just made
a mistake in the calculations. I just
made a helluva mistake&mdash;"</p>

<p>The wind sighed over the naked
rock and the rusted metal and the
rock and the dead blue water.</p>

<p>He turned and pushed his head
against the rock, and his body
curled up against the bitter wind.
"You've got to forgive me," he
said.</p>

<p>"'<i>Has anybody here seen Kelly?
K-E-double-L-Y?</i>'"</p>

<p>He shivered and kept his eyes
closed. It was part of the wind. He
did not want to go out that way,
hearing crazy voices in the wind.</p>

<p>"'Has anybody here seen
Kelly&mdash;?'"</p>

<p>He raised his head and blinked
and the wind drove tears down his
cheeks.</p>

<p>"Am I just hearing something
that's going crazy inside my head?"
He peered around. There was nothing,
nothing anywhere of course,
nothing where nothing had ever
been, and nothing else but nothing
could ever be.</p>

<p>"You're wrong, Kelly. Your
Crew's here."</p>

<p>Kelly raised himself painfully to
an elbow. "Where&mdash;<i>where</i>?"</p>

<p>"Right here, Kelly. We had a
difficult time locating you. Sure, we
forgive you. You were trying to do
what was right. We know that."</p>

<p>"There's nothing&mdash;nothing&mdash;"
Kelly said.</p>

<p>"You're wrong. The Crew's here
and we're waiting."</p>

<p>He stared at the rock. He put his
face against it and pushed his
hands to it. There was a kind of
dull glow in it, a faint hint of
warmth in the rock.</p>

<p>"How can this be?" Kelly said.</p>

<p>"This is the life here, Kelly. Perhaps
there is life everywhere in the
most impossible seeming places.
And where life is, Kelly, we can
live with it and be welcomed by it.
Here, this rock is life, and it has
taken us in. It has been here a long
time. And it will be here for a much
longer time."</p>

<p>"Rock," Kelly said.</p>

<p>"But hurry and come back."</p>

<p>"But no one will ever know.
How long&mdash;how long can we wait?"</p>

<p>"Who can answer that, Kelly?
But maybe they will find the Crew
someday."</p>

<p>Kelly looked up once at the completely
unfamiliar distances growing
darker. Sometime, he thought,
they'll come from wherever Earth
is and find the Crew of the ship,
find a rock here waiting the ages
out.</p>

<p>"Hurry, Kelly!"</p>

<p>His head dropped against the
rock. His hands slid down it, and a
smile moved over his lips and froze
there as the wind whispered over it.</p>
